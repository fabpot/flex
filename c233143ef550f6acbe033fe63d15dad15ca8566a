@fabpot let me know if this is OK or should I change something, I will still be working on this anyway.

Could you post a screenshot please?

EDIT crap, I mixed the colours on the removing files command, they should be inversed.
EDIT 2 fixed the removal image
EDIT 3 replaced the image with how it works now

![install_remove](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2230556/34650530-f04ed8b6-f3c2-11e7-8e92-e6fc8f7ac561.jpeg)

The double slash in some of the file paths is added due to a [lack of check](https://github.com/symfony/flex/blob/master/src/Configurator/CopyFromRecipeConfigurator.php#L49) of whether there is already one or not, I think. If it is due to my changes, I am unable to pinpoint the root cause.

@nicolas-grekas @fabpot I have performed the requested changes and posted a screenshot of two packages being added and removed (see above). Please tell me if this is OK and if it is, I will continue the work on this.

Fixing the double-slash would be a nice bonus :)

I cannot see the "Removing entries in ..." in your PR, should probably be "Removed entries in ..." to be consistent with the other messages.

You mean the [.gitignore](https://github.com/symfony/flex/blob/master/src/Configurator/GitignoreConfigurator.php#L49) messages? Was not added by me, but I can adjust my messages to say "Creating / Removing" if we are aiming for consistency. I will also fix that double slash.

Anyways, I did the minimum set of changes to see if I am going in the right direction, so I have only added these two messages. I still have more to go, which is removing directory message and the whole `CopyFromPackageConfigurator`.

EDIT also, I have noticed [some tests](https://github.com/symfony/flex/blob/master/tests/Configurator/BundlesConfiguratorTest.php#L27) are using string class names instead of the `::class` magic constant. Should I also change these?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The removing message indeed already exists. It shows up in your screenshot. And indeed, I think changing it is required for more consistency.

I think you are indeed in the right direction.

@stof @fabpot I have added requested changes. If you find it OK, I will add more tests and the verbosity check.

@stof [this bit here](https://github.com/symfony/flex/blob/master/src/Configurator/AbstractConfigurator.php#L47) only outputs the messages when the `verbose` flag is on, do you want me to check different levels of verbosity as well?
