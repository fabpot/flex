Magic! ðŸ”®

@teohhanhui I understand we don't always have enough time to write detailed comments ... but please don't add comments like *"Magic!"* because they don't help much to the discussion.

For example, you think this is magic and therefore bad. Could you please describe some scenarios where this feature would backfire us? For example:

* If I do ........ and then ......., this feature will be confusing because the result will be ....... instead of ........
* This feature will change .......... when doing ......... and that will be confusing to users
* etc.

Thanks!

@javiereguiluz Sorry, it was just a fun comment. I didn't mean for it to be negative. :smile:

But, yes, I do have a concern. This might affect other projects that use Symfony Flex and actually intend to use unbounded constraints. (*Why?*)

In case one is wondering, this applies only to packages in symfony/symfony

Just to be sure, will this not cause any problems with `symfony/<some>-pack`? Since the version of the packs are 1.* at the moment.

Edit: didn't see Nicolas' comment when posting mine.

> cause any problems with symfony/<some>-pack

I need to check that, you might be right!

Fixed: the replacement applies now only to packages listed at https://flex.symfony.com/versions.json
