Oh, and for the coding standards, I should have just pointed you at fabbot (one of the CI checks): https://fabbot.io/report/symfony/flex/885/d84cd84094be56d55cfd5db080db4c40a6dcce16 - you can fix everything automatically from there.

Hello @weaverryan ðŸ‘‹

That's ok I think every code style problem is now fixed. Sorry I didn't take the time to properly check the code standards before submitting. Thanks for the feedback and for the great symfonycast ðŸ¤˜

Cheers !
