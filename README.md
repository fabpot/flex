**WARNING** Symfony Flex is alpha software; use it at your own risk, protect
your code with a source code management tool.

[Symfony][1] Flex helps developers create Symfony applications, from the most
simple micro-style projects to the more complex ones with dozens of
dependencies.

FLEX_SKIP_REGISTRATION=1 create-project 
or anytime, just remove the flex-id item in composer.json. re-add it whenever you want as an empty string to regenerate a new ID
when new ID, how do we populate the list of initial recipe sha1s?

We can send the full composer.lock, we need this to run the security checker (store only the info needed for that)
Don't send the full composer.lock, just the bare minimum we need as a JSON payload
