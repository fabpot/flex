I cloned symfony/skeleton and `composer install` with this patch applied - everything looked happy :)

I think we should instead use the `Cache` defined in Flex because it extends from `Composer\Cache`.
Just delete line 14 should be enough in my opinion

@maxhelias Cache in the flex namespace has a different responsibility, we should really use Composer's here.
