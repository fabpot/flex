Why don't you use `api.github.com` for private recipes?

2 points here:
* Rate limitations (#834)
* Re-use existing [recipes-checker](https://github.com/symfony-tools/recipes-checker) tool to build recipe

Passing the token solves the rate limiting problem (as the rate limit is much higher for authenticated requests: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting)

Ok, let's close this PR then as after forking recipes-checker and [reverting changes](https://github.com/symfony-tools/recipes-checker/commit/e0bdb0aa9e90523c627c27e25d25cf3362c6a6c3) to use api.github.com it works fine for private repos.

My idea initially was to use original recipes-checker for own private/public repos, but it seems some changes are required on [checker side](https://github.com/symfony-tools/recipes-checker/compare/main...aivus:private-support?expand=1) besides URLs.

I'd be happy to make the recipe-checker a bit more generic if you're up for a PR.
