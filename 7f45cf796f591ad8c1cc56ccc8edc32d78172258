... and that removes a SPoF, which is always nice :)

While I always appreciate the technological economization of any ecosystem by removing weak technological dependencies, such as one operated by a company, and moving to community-accepted conventions, such as foundations or any other kind of common place,

how is this PR removing a single point of failure if all it does is replacing `flex.symfony.com` with GitHub as the source?

SPoF == servers as you mention, but it's also about the number of people maintaining the server/code.

Does this make sense to have something similar to composer repositories?

Where I can add a certain in-house hosted flex recipe server which holds proprietary recipes before looking into the default one?

Or is this change exactly this?
Couldn't figure out using the source.

@icanhazstring yep, that's what the code does already: define `extra.symfony.endpoint` in the root `composer.json` to the list of endpoints you want for your app (~you'll have to duplicate the default endpoints, but they're stable so that should be OK~ use `flex://defaults` in that list if wanted)
