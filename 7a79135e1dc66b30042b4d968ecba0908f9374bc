Hmm, on the other side, an endpoint that doesn't declare splits is likely broken as that means the `extra.symfony.require` entry will not work.
Maybe we should throw instead?

Which specific exception would be the most appropriate to throw?

A LogicException would be fine to me.

I changed the PR to throw a LogicException.
