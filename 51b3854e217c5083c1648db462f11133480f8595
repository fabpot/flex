What about doing this one level higher by just not allowing to remove the recipe applied for `symfony/flex`?

LGTM for @xabbuh's proposal.

But then some of FrameworkBundle's gitignore should be moved to the flex recipe (.env and vendor), isn't it?

I prefer the *current* patch over @xabbuh's proposal, actually. It makes more sense to me to day "`.git` is special, don't remove it" versus "the entire symfony/flex recipe is special, don't remove it".

üëç for the PR as it is currently
